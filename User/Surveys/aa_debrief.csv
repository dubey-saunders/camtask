Thank you for taking part in this study. This study focuses on the influence of high social anxiety, low social motivation and high autistic traits in typical adults and the possible links to high social avoidance. This research study aims to explore this by evaluating if low social approach is in typical adults can be predicted by their social anxiety or by their autistic traits. Also, the research aims to see whether low social motivation in typical adults would be associated with low social seeking. Similarly, this study would also investigate if the avoidance of social stimuli can be attributed to social anxiety, autistic traits or their interactions in those adults who have both high social anxiety and high autistic traits.
