<h3> Exploring intolerance of uncertainty and sensory sensitivity as mechanisms of anxiety in autistic and neurotypical adults.</h3>

Researcher/Student: Jasmine Saunders msxjs23@nottingham.ac.uk | Supervisor/Chief investigator: Dr Indu Dubey indu.dubey2@nottingham.ac.uk | Collaborator: Dr Anthony Haffey, Lecturer, School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences, 
University of Reading a.haffey@reading.ac.uk<br><br>

We would like to invite you to take part in a research study about factors which may play a role in anxiety in adults with and without autism. Before you begin, we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it involves for you. <br><br>

<h4>What is the purpose of this study? </h4>
I am a postgraduate student at the University of Nottingham studying for an MSc in Mental Health research and practice. I am conducting this study for my research project which will allow me to complete and gain my MSc qualification. The aim of this research is to investigate intolerance of uncertainty, sensory sensitivity, and anxiety in adults who do and do not identify as having autism. Specifically, I aim to investigate how varying levels of intolerance of uncertainty, and sensory sensitivity may (or may not) influence anxiety, and how this may differ between adults with and without autism. We cannot promise the study will help you but the information we get from this study may help us gain a deeper understanding of the role(s) intolerance of uncertainty and sensory sensitivity may play in anxiety, both in typical and autism-identifying adults. This could help in development of targeted intervention for co-occurring anxiety in autism.<br><br>

<h4>Why have I been invited? </h4>
I am asking adults (over 18 years old) to complete this online study. You have been identified because you responded to an earlier invitation to take part in this research. Ideally, I am hoping to recruit around 140 participants for this study (70 participants who identify as autistic and 70 who do not).<br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form when directed to the online study. You may change your mind about being involved at any time or decline to discuss a particular question. You are free to withdraw at any point before or during the study without giving a reason. You may also withdraw after the study, but if you wish to do so this must be done within 3 days following completion. If you wish to withdraw, please contact the student researcher with your participant code (which you will be assigned when you do the study), and all of your data will then be removed. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personally-identifiable information possible. There will also be an opportunity to enter a prize draw for taking part in the study of £25, and there will be 8 prizes available. If you wish to enter, you will need to provide the researcher with your email address so that you can be contacted if you win. <br><br>

<h4>What will I be asked to do? </h4>
If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online study. Before beginning the study, you will be asked to read and sign a consent form. You will then be provided with a short form to provide demographic information such as your gender and age. You will not be required to disclose your name or personal information; you will have a unique identification code generated in the event your data needs to be accessed later should you wish to withdraw. You will then be required to complete the study. You will be presented with self-report questionnaires regarding autistic traits, anxiety, sensory sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty. Following this, you will be required to complete 2 interactive behavioural tasks; one will be a “sensory sensitivity” task, the other will be an “intolerance of uncertainty” task. The study may take up to 90 minutes, therefore collection of data may be split into two or three shorter sessions to work through all the questionnaires/tasks. <br><br>

<h4>What will happen to the information I provide?</h4>
Your data will be used by the researcher to complete their postgraduate research project. A summary of the study’s findings will be available upon request following completion of the study in September 2022. Data belonging to anybody who agrees to participate in this research will remain strictly anonymous. When your data is recorded, you will be assigned a unique ID code to correspond to your study responses; none of your personal or identifiable information will be exposed. Your data will not be shared with any third parties, and your identity and responses will not be directly or indirectly identifiable from any research findings presented in the final report. All data will be collected and stored in accordance with the University of Nottingham’s Code of Conduct and Research Ethics and data protection regulations. Following completion of this project, any raw data collected for the purpose of this research will be securely stored by the University for 7 years. Data will not be stored anywhere else; after this time all data will be appropriately removed. If you enter the prize draw, your email address will be protected and securely stored separate to any data obtained from the study, and it will be removed as soon as the winners of the draw have been contacted. <br><br>

<h4>Are there any possible disadvantages or risks in taking part?</h4>
We believe there are no known risks associated with this research study; however, as with any online activity the risk of a breach is always possible. We will do everything possible to ensure your answers in this study will remain anonymous. We don’t expect there to be any disadvantages or risks to taking part. In the unlikely event that it does give rise to any concerns for you, we advise you to discuss these with a trained professional, such as your general practitioner. Other areas to get support include the Samaritans, contactable on 116 123, or Mind, a mental health charity, contactable on 0300 123 3393. There is also the National Autistic Society; they do not have a direct helpline, but you will be able to find contact details for support and enquiries at https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/help-and-support, where you can also find contact details for support groups in your local area. <br><br>

<h4>Data Protection </h4>
We will follow ethical and legal practice and all information will be handled in confidence. Under UK Data Protection laws the University is the Data Controller (legally responsible for the data security) and the Chief Investigator of this study (named above) is the Data Custodian (manages access to the data). This means we are responsible for looking after your information and using it properly. Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited as we need to manage your information in specific ways to comply with certain laws and for the research to be reliable and accurate. To safeguard your rights we will use the minimum personally–identifiable information possible. You can find out more about how we use your information and to read our privacy notice at: 
https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utilities/privacy.aspx
We would like your permission to use anonymised data in future studies, and to share our research data (e.g. in online databases) with other researchers in other Universities and organisations both inside and outside the European Union. This would be used for research in health and social care. Sharing research data is important to allow peer scrutiny, re-use (and therefore avoiding duplication of research) and to understand the bigger picture in particular areas of research. All personal information that could identify you will be removed or changed before information is shared with other researchers or results are made public. 
The raw data collected for the study will be saved on the RedCap storage platform for University of 
Nottingham and University of Reading and will be accessible to the named researchers and 
collaborators. They may also be looked at by authorised people from regulatory organisations to check that the study is being carried out correctly. All will have a duty of confidentiality to you as a research participant and we will do our best to meet this duty. At the end of the project, all raw data will be kept securely by the University under the terms of its data protection policy after which it will be disposed of securely. The data will not be kept elsewhere. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. We can be contacted before and after your participation at the email addresses above. <br><br>

<h4>What if there is a problem?</h4>
If you have any queries or complaints, please contact the student’s supervisor/chief investigator in the first instance. If this does not resolve your query, please write to the Administrator to the Division of Psychiatry & Applied Psychology’s Research Ethics Sub-Committee adrian.pantry@nottingam.ac.uk who will pass your query to the Chair of the Committee. If you remain unhappy and wish to complain formally, you should then contact the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Ethics Committee Administrator, Faculty Hub, Medicine and Health Sciences, E41, E Floor, Medical School, Queen’s Medical Centre Campus, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, NG7 2UH or via E-mail: FMHS-ResearchEthics@nottingham.ac.uk <br><br>",instruct,,,,,
